## Usage

### Vue Projects

First, install the required skills:

```bash
npx skills add antfu/skills \
  --skill vue \
  --skill vue-best-practices \
  --skill nuxt  # For Nuxt projects
```

Then add the following to `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) in your project root to ensure the AI assistant loads the correct skills when working with Vue 3 SFCs:

```md
## Skills Activation Rules

`ycs77-vue` is the project-level convention. When rules conflict, `ycs77-vue` takes precedence.

- **When writing, modifying, or reviewing Vue 3 SFCs**, load ALL of the following skills:
  1. `vue`
  2. `vue-best-practices`
  3. `ycs77-vue`
```

> For Nuxt projects, also include `nuxt` in the list above.

## Generate Skills

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Update `meta.ts` with your own projects and skill sources
4. Run `pnpm start cleanup` to remove existing submodules and skills
5. Run `pnpm start init` to clone the submodules
6. Run `pnpm start sync` to sync vendored skills
7. Ask your agent to `Generate skills for <project>` (recommended one at a time to manage token usage)

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for detailed generation guidelines.
